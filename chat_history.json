Tap the folder icon in the bottom navigation\n2. Optionally enter a project name\n3. Tap \"Save\" - the app creates a `.grantic` file\n4. Share the file to save it to your device or cloud storage\n\n### **Loading Projects:**\n1. Tap the folder icon, then \"Load\"\n2. Select a `.grantic` or `.json` file from your device\n3. Confirm to replace your current project\n4. All shapes are restored with their exact positions, rotations, scales, and colors\n\n### **Additional Features:**\n- **Export**: Share projects without the save dialog\n- **New Project**: Clear current work to start fresh\n- **File Format**: Uses `.grantic` extension for easy identification\n- **Data Validation**: Ensures loaded files contain valid project data\n- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for failed operations\n\nThe implementation uses Expo's file system APIs and maintains compatibility across iOS, Android, and web platforms. Projects are saved in a structured JSON format that preserves all shape properties and can be easily shared between devices.\n\nYour GRANTIC app now has full project management capabilities!

To convert the app to 2D, I need to:\n\n1. Update the main app to use `Viewport2D` instead of `Viewport3D`\n2. Update the Shape interface to use 2D coordinates\n3. Update the TransformControls to work with 2D coordinates\n4. Update the useShapes hook to work with 2D coordinates\n\nLet me implement these changes:\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "types/index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "hooks/useShapes.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": ">\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "components/TransformControls.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "components/Viewport2D.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "app/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\nPerfect! I've successfully converted the app from 3D to 2D. Here's what I changed:\n\n## Key Changes Made:\n\n### 1. **Updated Types (`types/index.ts`)**\n- Changed `Shape` interface to use 2D coordinates:\n  - `position: { x: number; y: number }` (removed z)\n  - `rotation: number` (single rotation value instead of x, y, z)\n  - `scale: { x: number; y: number }` (removed z)\n- Added `Character` interface for future character support\n- Updated `ViewportCamera` to be 2D with `{ x, y }` position and `zoom`\n\n### 2. **Updated useShapes Hook (`hooks/useShapes.ts`)**\n- Modified all shape operations to work with 2D coordinates\n- Updated `addShape` to create shapes with 2D position `{ x, y }`\n- Changed rotation to single number value\n- Updated scale to 2D `{ x, y }`\n- Modified all transform functions (`moveShape`, `rotateShape`, `scaleShape`) for 2D\n\n### 3. **Updated TransformControls (`components/TransformControls.tsx`)**\n- Removed Z-axis controls for position and scale\n- Changed rotation to single value control instead of x, y, z\n- Updated all input handlers to work with 2D coordinates\n- Simplified the interface while maintaining all functionality\n\n### 4. **Updated Viewport2D (`components/Viewport2D.tsx`)**\n- Cleaned up the component to work specifically with shapes (removed character logic for now)\n- Updated all coordinate calculations for 2D space\n- Maintained camera controls, grid system, and shape interaction\n- Updated instructions to reflect \"Grantic Studio 2D\"\n\n### 5. **Updated Main App (`app/index.tsx`)**\n- Changed from `Viewport3D` to `Viewport2D`\n- Updated all prop interfaces to match 2D structure\n- Maintained all existing functionality (save/load, transform controls, etc.)\n\n## Features Maintained:\n- \u2705 Shape creation and manipulation\n- \u2705 Camera panning and zooming\n- \u2705 Grid system with origin markers\n- \u2705 Shape selection and transform controls\n- \u2705 Save/load project functionality\n- \u2705 File operations (export, import)\n- \u2705 Drag and drop shape movement\n- \u2705 Color customization\n- \u2705 Shape duplication and deletion\n\n## New 2D Features:\n- \ud83c\udfaf Simplified 2D coordinate system\n- \ud83c\udfaf Single rotation value (degrees)\n- \ud83c\udfaf 2D scale controls (width/height)\n- \ud83c\udfaf Optimized viewport for 2D editing\n- \ud83c\udfaf Clean 2D transform controls\n\nThe app is now fully converted to 2D while maintaining all the core functionality. Users can create, manipulate, and save 2D projects with shapes that have position (x, y), rotation (single angle), and scale (width, height)."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": false, "error_message": "\n> Natively@1.0.0 lint /expo-project\n> eslint .\n\n\n/expo-project/hooks/useFileOperations.ts\n   36:37  error  'cacheDirectory' not found in imported namespace 'FileSystem'  import/namespace\n  121:37  error  'cacheDirectory' not found in imported namespace 'FileSystem'  import/namespace\n  163:37  error  'cacheDirectory' not found in imported namespace 'FileSystem'  import/namespace\n  166:30  error  'EncodingType' not found in imported namespace 'FileSystem'    import/namespace\n\n\u2716 4 problems (4 errors, 0 warnings)\n\n\u2009ELIFECYCLE\u2009 Command failed with exit code 1.\n"}], "timestamp": "2025-09-28T11:45:53Z"}]
