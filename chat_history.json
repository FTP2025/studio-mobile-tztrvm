Tap the folder icon in the bottom navigation\n2. Optionally enter a project name\n3. Tap \"Save\" - the app creates a `.grantic` file\n4. Share the file to save it to your device or cloud storage\n\n### **Loading Projects:**\n1. Tap the folder icon, then \"Load\"\n2. Select a `.grantic` or `.json` file from your device\n3. Confirm to replace your current project\n4. All shapes are restored with their exact positions, rotations, scales, and colors\n\n### **Additional Features:**\n- **Export**: Share projects without the save dialog\n- **New Project**: Clear current work to start fresh\n- **File Format**: Uses `.grantic` extension for easy identification\n- **Data Validation**: Ensures loaded files contain valid project data\n- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for failed operations\n\nThe implementation uses Expo's file system APIs and maintains compatibility across iOS, Android, and web platforms. Projects are saved in a structured JSON format that preserves all shape properties and can be easily shared between devices.\n\nYour GRANTIC app now has full project management capabilities!
